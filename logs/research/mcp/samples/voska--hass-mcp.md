# Sample

## Identification
- url: https://github.com/voska/hass-mcp
- stars: 287
- last-commit (date or relative): August 5, 2025 (v0.1.1 release)
- license: MIT (per README badges; pyproject.toml did not declare)
- default branch: master
- one-line purpose: Home Assistant MCP server — Docker-first distribution; long-lived access token auth; Python 3.13 floor.

## 1. Language and runtime
- language(s) + version constraints: Python 99.6% — `requires-python = ">=3.13"`
- framework/SDK in use: raw `mcp[cli]>=1.4.1`
- pitfalls observed:
  - **Python 3.13 floor** — aggressive version requirement; most Python MCP servers target 3.10+
  - **Python 3.13 requirement** on a relatively popular (287 stars) production server — uncommon floor

## 2. Transport
- supported transports: stdio (wrapped in Docker or uvx)
- how selected: default stdio; Docker container runs the stdio server inside
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 3. Distribution
- every mechanism observed: Docker Hub (`voska/hass-mcp:latest`); `uvx hass-mcp`
- published package name(s): `hass-mcp` on PyPI (inferred from `uvx hass-mcp` install one-liner)
- install commands shown in README:
  - `docker pull voska/hass-mcp:latest`
  - `uvx hass-mcp`
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 4. Entry point / launch
- command(s) users/hosts run: `docker run -i --rm -e HA_URL -e HA_TOKEN voska/hass-mcp`; `uvx hass-mcp`
- wrapper scripts, launchers, stubs: console script `hass-mcp` → `app.run:main`
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 5. Configuration surface
- how config reaches the server: environment variables `HA_URL`, `HA_TOKEN`
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 6. Authentication
- flow: Home Assistant long-lived access token
- where credentials come from: `HA_TOKEN` env var injected into the container or uvx process
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 7. Multi-tenancy
- single-user / per-request tenant / workspace-keyed / not applicable / other: single-user per Home Assistant instance
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 8. Capabilities exposed
- tools / resources / prompts / sampling / roots / logging / other: tools for controlling HA entities, querying states, executing services, managing automations — parent `homeassistant-ai/ha-mcp` advertises 80+ tools; this variant is more focused
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 9. Observability
- logging destination + format, metrics, tracing, debug flags: not captured
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 10. Host integrations shown in README or repo
- Claude Desktop — JSON snippet shown with Docker `command`/`args`; `HA_URL` + `HA_TOKEN` env
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 11. Claude Code plugin wrapper

### presence and shape

none shown

### pitfalls observed

none noted in this repo

## 12. Tests
- presence, framework, location, notable patterns: pytest mentioned; GitHub Actions workflow directory present
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 13. CI
- presence, system, triggers, what it runs: GitHub Actions — details not extracted
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 14. Container / packaging artifacts
- Dockerfile, docker-compose, Helm, systemd, brew formula, etc.: Dockerfile; official image `voska/hass-mcp:latest` on Docker Hub — **Docker as the primary distribution channel**
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 15. Example client / developer ergonomics
- MCP Inspector launcher, curl stubs, make targets, dev scripts, sample configs: Claude Desktop JSON example embedded in README
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 16. Repo layout
- single-package / monorepo / vendored / other: single-package (`app/` module)
- pitfalls observed: none noted in this repo

## 17. Notable structural choices
- **Python 3.13 floor** — aggressive version requirement; most Python MCP servers target 3.10+
- **Docker as the primary distribution channel** — README leads with `docker pull` and shows the Claude Desktop config using Docker as the `command`
- **Two-dep server** (`mcp[cli]` + `httpx`) — REST client over HA's REST API, minimal abstraction
- Non-`awslabs.` namespace but similar top-level module name pattern: `hass-mcp` binary → `app.run:main` (module is just `app`, not `hass_mcp`)

## 18. Unanticipated axes observed
- **Docker-first distribution for home-automation servers** — many users run HA in Docker already; bundling the MCP server in the same paradigm matches operator mental models
- **Python 3.13 requirement** on a relatively popular (287 stars) production server — uncommon floor
- Bare `app` module name rather than `hass_mcp` package — unusual naming; suggests template-derived structure

## 19. Python-specific

### SDK / framework variant
- raw `mcp` Python SDK / FastMCP 1.x / FastMCP 2.x / custom: raw `mcp[cli]>=1.4.1` — older pin than awslabs sub-servers (>=1.23.0)
- version pin from pyproject.toml: `mcp[cli]>=1.4.1`, `httpx>=0.27.0`
- import pattern observed: `from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP` is likely given `[cli]` extra; not confirmed

### Python version floor
- `requires-python` value: `>=3.13`

### Packaging
- build backend: hatchling
- lock file present: `.python-version` file referenced
- version manager convention: `uv` / `uvx`

### Entry point
- `[project.scripts]` console script / `__main__.py` module / bare script / other: console script
- actual console-script name(s): `hass-mcp`
- host-config snippet shape (uvx / uv run / pipx / python -m / absolute venv path): Docker-first (`"command": "docker"`); uvx as alternative

### Install workflow expected of end users
- install form + one-liner from README: `docker pull voska/hass-mcp:latest` (primary); `uvx hass-mcp` (secondary)

### Async and tool signatures
- sync `def` or `async def`: httpx + MCP SDK — likely async

### Type / schema strategy
- Pydantic / dataclasses / TypedDict / raw dict / Annotated: not captured — Pydantic arrives via `mcp[cli]` extra

### Testing
- pytest / pytest-asyncio / unittest / none: pytest (per README mention)

### Dev ergonomics
- mcp dev / fastmcp dev / Inspector launcher / Makefile / Justfile / other: not captured

### Notable Python-specific choices
- Very small dep set (2 runtime deps)
- Requires Python 3.13 — tracks modern Python features or standard library additions
- Module name `app` (bare) vs conventional `hass_mcp` package

## 20. Gaps
- what couldn't be determined: exact CI workflow, tool count, whether resources or prompts are used, pyproject license field (README shows MIT badge)
